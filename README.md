This is an simple application which loads info from "https://api.nasa.gov API" and show the data for each day
It uses below components
1.Retrofit(For Network calls)
2.Viewmodel and Live data(MVVM Architectural Pattern)
3.Hilt(For DI and now it's stable as confirmed in recent  google I/O)
4.Room ORM (for storing a single day object)


This project is based on MVVM architectural pattern and written in Kotlin


Improvement Areas
1.data binding could have been used(Time Tradeoff)
2.Glide could have been used in much better way
3.Network Helper class could be used more wisely
